In this assignment I was still working on getting the tiles to be on top of the squares they are being placed.
The issue is that when they are added to the div it keeps the possition values from their origin and they get 
pushed up and to the side. They are still in the div tiles so the functionality is fine it just looks weird from 
a user perspective. 
The putting of tiles into the slots on the board works, when you hit the submit button it will take in the letters 
stopping at the first empty space and updait your score acordingly and displays the previously entered word on the scoreboard
